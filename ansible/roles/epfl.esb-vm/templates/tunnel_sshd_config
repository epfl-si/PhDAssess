# These parts come from the Docker container's original sshd_config:
PasswordAuthentication no
AuthorizedKeysFile	.ssh/authorized_keys
X11Forwarding no
PidFile /config/sshd.pid
Subsystem	sftp	/usr/lib/ssh/sftp-server -u 022

# These were tweaked so that we can have nice things:
AllowTcpForwarding yes
GatewayPorts yes
{# Must keep PermitListen and PermitOpen stanzas in sync with the
 # requirements of the client, as seen in the DeploymentConfig in
 # ../../epfl.phd-assess/tasks/ssh-tunnel-client.yml. Note that the
 # `-M` port needs to be permitted both ways, as `autossh` sets up
 # that port as `-R`, then `-L`s right back into it in order to
 # monitor liveness:
